[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ununseptium/skill-calculator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ununseptium/skill-calculator)

This is the repository for the Skill Calculator based on Tom Clancy's The Division. The Skill Calculator was originally made by [Miodec](https://www.reddit.com/user/miodec) and is now continued and maintained by some guys from the [Discord Community](http://thedivisiondiscord.com) of the Game.

### Technology which is used

- Gulp
- Sass
- Angular.js

### Roadmap

This refers to the [Version 2 Milestone](https://github.com/ununseptium/skill-calculator/milestones). The following list contains the most important stuff that needs to be done until Version 2 can be released.

 - [x] Put that whole thing on Github to make it Open Source
 - [x] Create a development workflow
  - [x] [Testing with Travis](https://github.com/ununseptium/skill-calculator/commit/ea0010b035feb41439f5053094cf7aaaf4c63724)
  - [x] [Automatic deployment to heroku](https://github.com/ununseptium/skill-calculator/commit/fd6ce68e1aa345c311a0bb73394bdb91a5a235b3)
 - [ ] Rearrange how the data is handled (Work in Progress | [Pull-Request #10](https://github.com/ununseptium/skill-calculator/pull/10))
 - [ ] Add calculation
 
### Usage

Once you either cloned or downloaded the source run `npm install` to install the dependencies. **Make sure to have gulp installed globally**.

If `npm install` quits without telling you that something horrible happend you're ready to fire `gulp`.
This will compile the source, watch for changes and reload the browser window if a file is changed. **Pure Magic**.
