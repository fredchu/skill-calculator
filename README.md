# skill-calculator

This is the repository for the Skill Calculator based on Tom Clancy's The Division. The Skill Calculator was originally made by [Miodec](https://www.reddit.com/user/miodec) and is now continued and maintained by some guys from the [Discord Community](http://thedivisiondiscord.com) of the Game.

### Technology which is going to be used

- Gulp
- Sass
- Angular.js

### Usage

Once you either cloned or downloaded the source run `npm install` to install the dependencies. **Make sure to have gulp installed globally**.

If `npm install` quits without telling you that something horrible happend you're ready to fire `gulp`.
This will compile the source, watch for changes and reload the browser window if you save changes. **Pure Magic**.
