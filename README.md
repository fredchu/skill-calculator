This is the repository for the Skill Calculator based on Tom Clancy's The Division. The Skill Calculator was originally made by [Miodec](https://www.reddit.com/user/miodec) and is now continued and maintained by some guys from the [Discord Community](http://thedivisiondiscord.com) of the Game.

## App will be shut down 1st September 2016

### Technology which is used

- Node
- Gulp
- Sass
- Angular.js

### Usage

First of all you need to have Node + Npm installed. Checkout https://nodejs.org/en/

Once you either cloned or downloaded the source, you can run `npm install` (while using a command line prompt pointed to the downloaded folder) to install the dependencies. **Make sure to have gulp installed globally** (`npm install -g gulp`).

If `npm install` quits without telling you that something horrible happend you're ready to fire `gulp`.
This will compile the source, watch for changes and reload the browser window if a file is changed. **Pure Magic**.

### Contribute
Fork this and make it your own.

I'm not going to continue this repository anymore and will take down the website 1st September 2016. I've written an article about that: https://medium.com/@nevotheless/end-of-skill-calculator-7bf1de21ee9f
