  "body": "### App shutdown notice\r\nYou see this, because the offical web application for the skill-calculator has been shutdown since it's not actively developed anymore. Also, i don't want to continue hosting and supporting this app since i don't have fun with the game anymore. I actually never enjoyed the game as i hoped it would and it quite disappointed me. \r\n\r\n### Farewell gift\r\nIt feels kinda wrong to just abandon this project. So because of this and to honor all the people who ever contributed something to the app i created executable versions for all major platforms so you can still use the app on your own machine.\r\n\r\n### Download Standalone Version\r\n* [Linux 32-bit](https://github.com/ununseptium/skill-calculator/releases/download/v3.0.0/Skill.Calculator-linux-ia32.tgz)\r\n* [Linux 64-bit](https://github.com/ununseptium/skill-calculator/releases/download/v3.0.0/Skill.Calculator-linux-x64.tgz)\r\n* [Windows 32-bit](https://github.com/ununseptium/skill-calculator/releases/download/v3.0.0/Skill.Calculator-win32-ia32.zip)\r\n* [Windows 64-bit](https://github.com/ununseptium/skill-calculator/releases/download/v3.0.0/Skill.Calculator-win32-x64.zip)\r\n* [Mac OS](https://github.com/ununseptium/skill-calculator/releases/download/v3.0.0/Skill.Calculator-darwin-x64.dmg)\r\n\r\n### Thanks and goodbye\r\nThe last thing i have left to say is **thank you** to the division community and especially to the discord server community.\r\n\r\n**Goodbye and game on**,\r\n\r\nnevotheless",
